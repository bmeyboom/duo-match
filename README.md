# <i><b>Duo-Match</b></i>
A MakeUC hackathon project. The product - an app - connects people who are trying to learn a language through a Duolingo-like app (in theory it is connected to Duolingo directly) so that they can get practice speaking the language. 

## The way it works
A person may speak English and is trying to learn French. Another person may speak French and is trying to learn English. Since their native tongues are each what the other is trying to learn, and their to-learn language level is the same (determined through their Duolingo score), they are matched and can either chat, call or video call!
